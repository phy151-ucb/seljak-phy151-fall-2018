{\bf Course Syllabus}
\end{center}

{\bf Learning goals}: The goals of the course is to get acquainted with modern computational methods
used in physical sciences, including numerical analysis methods, data science and statistics. 
We will introduce a number of concepts that are useful in physical sciences at varying depth levels. We will cover main numerical methods used in physical sciences. Most of the statistical concepts will be Bayesian, 
emphasizing the concepts that have a connection to physical sciences, such as classical and statistical mechanics. We will focus on data science and data analysis concepts that are often encountered in real world physical science applications. 

{\bf Target audience}:
target student population are upper division undergraduates from physical science departments, as well as beginning graduate students from the same departments.

{\bf Course structure}: each week there will be a set of 3 hour lectures discussing theoretical and practical underpinnings of the specific topic,
together with its most common applications in physical sciences. This will be followed by a weekly python based homework assignment,
applying a subset of the methods to physical science based applications. There will be a one hour discussion of the lecture material and homeworks.

{\bf Software}: we will use Python Jupyter hub environment. You are expected to use existing numerical analysis routines and not write your own. Many of these are already
implemented in python libraries (scipy, numpy...), or you can call Numerical Recipes C++ routines (as well as other
routines) from python (see http://numerical.recipes for details). 
%Routines that go with Landau's book are at
%http://www.science.oregonstate.edu/~landaur/Books/CPbook/Codes/PythonCodes/
\newline

{\bf Prerequisites}: 
Undergraduate students: PHY7 or PHY5 series, 
basic introduction to Python programming at the level of PHY77 or permission from instructor. 
Some knowledge of analytic mechanics and statistical physics at the level of PHY105 and PHY112 will be assumed. Graduate students: equivalent of PHY105 and 112, and basic introduction to Python programming, or permission from instructor. 
\newline

{\bf Homeworks and Final Exam}: weekly homeworks, Jupyter notebook in Python submissions. 
Throughout the course, students will complete and electronically submit one homework assignment (code) per week. This code will be run on test cases to check if it produces appropriate results. The GSI will also examine code for proper commenting and style. If the code does not produce appropriate results from the test cases, GSIs will also check for errors to award partial credit for students’ efforts. These manual examinations for errors may be more or less thorough depending on enrollment and availability of the GSI. 
There will be a take home final exam covering the last few weeks of lectures, following the same structure as the homeworks. Take home exam may differ between undergraduate and graduate students. 
\newline

{\bf Grades}: 30\% final project, 70\% homeworks.
