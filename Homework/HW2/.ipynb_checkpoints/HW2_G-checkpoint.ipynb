So the data $D$ consists of the value of <b>d</b>, and a statement of whether the prize was revealed. It is hard to say what the probabilities of these outcomes are, since they depend on our beliefs about the reliability of the door latches and the properties of earthquakes, but it is possible to extract the desired posterior probability without naming the values of $P($<b>d</b>$|\\mathcal{H}_i)$ for each <b>d</b>. <br><br>\n",
    "All that matters are the relative values of the quantities $P(D|\\mathcal{H}_1)$, $P(D|\\mathcal{H}_2)$, $P(D|\\mathcal{H}_3)$, for the value of $D$ that actually occurred. The value of $D$ that actually occurred is ‘<b>d</b> = (0, 0, 1), and no prize visible’.\n",
