    "#### Problem - LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "On February 11 2016, the LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory) and Virgo collaboration announced the first observation of gravitational waves from the collision and merger of a pair of black holes. Such observation was made on 14 September 2015 by the two detectors of the LIGO (Hanford and Livington); hence, the signal was named \"GW150914.\" This event took place in a distant galaxy more than one billion light years from the Earth. LIGO estimated that the peak gravitational-wave power radiated during the final moments of the black hole merger was more than ten times greater than the combined light power from all the stars and galaxies in the observable Universe. This remarkable discovery marks the beginning of an exciting new era of astronomy as we open an entirely new, gravitational-wave, window on the Universe. The 2017 Nobel Prize was awarded to researchers of the LIGO/Virgo collaboration for such discovery (https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2017/press.html).\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Gravitational waves are \"ripples\" in space-time produced by some of the most violent events in the cosmos, such as the collisions and mergers of massive compact stars. Their existence was predicted by Einstein in 1916, when he showed that accelerating massive objects would shake space-time so much that waves of distorted space would radiate from the source. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In the same year that Einstein predicted gravitational waves, the physicist Karl Schwarzschild showed that Einstein's work permitted the existence of black holes. There have been dramatic improvements in our theoretical understanding of these bizarre objects - including, over the past decade, some remarkable advances in modeling a pair of black holes (referred to as a binary) through several close orbits before they finally merge. These computer models have allowed us to construct precise gravitational waveforms - i.e. the pattern of gravitational waves emitted by the black holes as they approach ever closer and finally merge into a single, larger black hole - in accordance with the predictions of general relativity. The direct observation of a binary black hole merger would therefore provide a powerful cosmic laboratory for testing Einstein's theory.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<img src=\"BHmerger.png\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" />\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The above image shows the predictions of the best-matching waveform computed from general relativity, over the three stages of the event: inspiral, merger and ringdown. A visual simulation is available here: http://www.glowscript.org/#/user/rhilborn/folder/Public/program/BinaryInSpiral\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "LIGO comprised of two giant laser interferometers located thousands of kilometers apart, one in Livingston, Louisiana and the other in Hanford, Washington. As shown in the below simplified diagram, an interferometer like LIGO consists of two \"arms\" (each one 4km long) at right angles to each other, along which a laser beam is shone and reflected by mirrors (suspended as test masses) at each end. When a gravitational wave passes by, the stretching and squashing of space causes the arms of the interferometer alternately to lengthen and shrink, one getting longer while the other gets shorter and then vice-versa. As the interferometers' arms change lengths, the laser beams take a different time to travel through the arms - which means that the two beams are no longer \"in step\" (or in phase) and what we call an interference pattern is produced. This is why we refer to the LIGO detectors as \"interferometers\".\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<img src=\"LIGO_detector.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" />\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "The difference between the two arm lengths is proportional to the strength of the passing gravitational wave, referred to as the <b>gravitational-wave strain</b>, and this number is mind-bogglingly small. For a gravitational wave typical of what we can detect, we expect the strain to be about 1/10,000th the width of a proton! However LIGO's interferometers are so sensitive that they can measure even such tiny amounts.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "In Project 2, we take the strain data from LIGO and use matched filtering to find hidden signals from noisy data. Ultimately, we aim to show that the waveform detected by LIGO matched the predictions of general relativity, confirming that LIGO has detected gravitational waves.\n",
