To finish your homework, carefully read the comments and make changes (define functions, make plots, fill in the blanks, etc).  The last cell (containts a line  _ = ok.submit() ) will submit your notebook. Run it with  Shift+Enter  to submit or re-submit.\nHere is an example   You can submit multiple times -- we only grade the lastest submission before the deadline.  The notebook can be saved to the Data8 system for the duration of the semester. This can be done by clicking the floppy disk (\ud83d\udcbe),\n   or clicking File/Save and Checkpoint. Have you ever seen a floppy disk?    Past Assignments:\nTo download a Jupyter notebook, right click the link and save it as an .ipynb file.
